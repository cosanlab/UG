### Ultimatum Game   

This is a paradigm in which users from Amazon's mechanical turk are matched in pairs to play a modified UG. Half of experimental games including a messaging component whereby users can influence each other's decisions.  

This paradigm is built using [Meteor.js](https://www.meteor.com/) a Javascript framework with fast easy-to-use client-server communication enabling effective realtime applications. This enables multi-user experimental design, aka real-time interactions over the internet. 

This paradigm uses the excellent [TurkServer](https://github.com/HarvardEconCS/turkserver-meteor) for handling all Mturk requests (e.g. HIT creation, Assignment handling, Worker Payment, etc).
